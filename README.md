Welcome to the SQL Data Exploration project focused on COVID-19. In this repository, we delve into the realm of SQL to analyze and extract insights from datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Features:
Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis of COVID-19 datasets.
Insight Extraction: Extract valuable insights and trends from the data to better comprehend the dynamics of the pandemic.
Visualization: Visualize the analyzed data using various SQL functions and techniques, creating informative charts and graphs.

Usage:
Explore the SQL Scripts:
Browse through the SQL scripts provided to understand the queries used for data analysis.
Run Queries:
Execute the SQL queries using your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
Visualize Data:
Use the extracted data to create visualizations or integrate it into other analytics tools for further exploration.


Aim:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct in-depth analysis using SQL queries on COVID-19 datasets focusing on vaccinations and mortality rates. By examining these datasets, we aim to extract valuable insights regarding vaccination progress, mortality trends, and their potential correlations.

Project Structure:

Scripts: Contains SQL scripts utilized for data analysis and exploration, specifically tailored for analyzing vaccination and mortality data.
Data: Stores COVID-19 datasets pertinent to vaccinations and mortality rates.
Visualizations: Includes visual representations derived from the analyzed data, providing clear insights into vaccination and mortality trends.
What is Dataset Analysis?
Dataset analysis involves the systematic examination of large datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. In the context of COVID-19 vaccinations and mortality, dataset analysis enables us to understand vaccination coverage, mortality rates, demographic disparities, and other critical aspects. Leveraging SQL queries, we can efficiently explore these datasets, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation in response to the pandemic.

Skills Used:

Joins
Converting Data Types
CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
Temp Tables (Temporary Tables)
Windows Functions
Aggregate Functions
Creating Views

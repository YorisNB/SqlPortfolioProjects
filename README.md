# First project : SQL Data exploration 

Features:

Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis of COVID-19 datasets.
Insight Extraction: Extract valuable insights and trends from the data to better comprehend the dynamics of the pandemic.
Visualization: Visualize the analyzed data using various SQL functions and techniques, creating informative charts and graphs.

Usage:

Explore the SQL Scripts:
Browse through the SQL scripts provided to understand the queries used for data analysis.
Run Queries:
Execute the SQL queries using your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
Visualize Data:
Use the extracted data to create visualizations or integrate it into other analytics tools for further exploration.


Aim:
The primary goal of this project is to conduct in-depth analysis using SQL queries on COVID-19 datasets focusing on vaccinations and mortality rates. By examining these datasets, we aim to extract valuable insights regarding vaccination progress, mortality trends, and their potential correlations.

Project Structure:

Scripts: Contains SQL scripts utilized for data analysis and exploration, specifically tailored for analyzing vaccination and mortality data.
Data: Stores COVID-19 datasets pertinent to vaccinations and mortality rates.
Visualizations: Includes visual representations derived from the analyzed data, providing clear insights into vaccination and mortality trends.
What is Dataset Analysis?
Dataset analysis involves the systematic examination of large datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. In the context of COVID-19 vaccinations and mortality, dataset analysis enables us to understand vaccination coverage, mortality rates, demographic disparities, and other critical aspects. Leveraging SQL queries, we can efficiently explore these datasets, facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation in response to the pandemic.

# Second project : SQL Data Cleaning 

Features:

Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to clean and perform analysis of housing datasets in Nashville.

Usage:

Exploring SQL Scripts:
Take a look at the provided SQL scripts to understand the data cleaning techniques and queries used for processing the Nashville house dataset.
Running Queries:
Execute the SQL queries using your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to clean the dataset according to the defined criteria and standards.
Analyzing Cleaned Data:
Utilize the cleaned dataset for further analysis, visualization, or integration into other analytics tools to extract valuable insights into the Nashville housing market.

Aim:
The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning in SQL for the Nashville house dataset. By cleaning the dataset, we aim to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability, laying a solid foundation for further analysis and insights extraction. The cleaned dataset will facilitate better understanding of housing market trends and dynamics in Nashville.

Project Structure:

Scripts:
Contains SQL scripts specifically designed for data cleaning tasks, including procedures for standardizing data formats, and removing duplicates.
